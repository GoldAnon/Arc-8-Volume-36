*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――The Imperial Capital of Lupugana was occupied by the undead.

In Lupugana, a city that was now best described as a city of corpses rather than the Imperial Capital, Al was searching and struggling alone for Priscilla, who had gone missing.

Nevertheless, it could not be said that the search for his master was going well.

The basic method of searching for people was to ask for eyewitness testimony. However, there was no one here to ask, not for conclusive testimony or even for useless gossip.

The only people who were around were either undead, who approached the living with a sinister purpose; or survivors who had survived by keeping their heads down, holding their breath, and not taking any action.

Either way, it was a useless party for Al's purposes.

Although――,

???: [The absurdity of the world is that just because you meet a living person, it doesn't mean that your objective is going forward, right, Al-San?]

The very absurdity of the world itself, Cecilus, exclaimed such.

While he was in complete agreement with that assessment, there was no room for Al now to quibble with this and that, as it were. ――Al was hanging over the edge of the roof of a five-story building.

Al: [――Shit.]

Swearing inside his iron helmet, Al turned his gaze away from Cecilus's smirking face.

It would be useless to say anything to Cecilus in this situation. In the first place, the reason why Al was hanging like this was because he was kicked off the rooftop by Cecilus. Moreover, he had kicked Al from behind after calling him over to the edge of the rooftop and making him think that there was something in the distance.

And if that was not a sign of malicious intent, then what was?

Cecilus: [The purpose is to test, or check, or something like that. Your reaction seems to be better than the boss's, as you didn't fall head first.]

Al: [Um, yeah. I have no idea what you mean.]

Cecilus: [It's fine if you don't understand! I know what I think and what I want. Also, I'm here to tell you that I will not be helping in pulling you up, Al-san.]

Cecilus clapped his hands nonchalantly as if he did not expect an answer to his statement.

Al did not know the reason for the murderous behavior until Cecilus spoke; actually, he still had no idea what the reason was, even after hearing the answer. Talking about hostility or murderous intent in the first place, Al had not had much of a conversation with Cecilus before this.

After being rescued from a powerful undead enemy, they briefly introduced themselves to each other. Al talked about his movements up to this point and his future goals, and then he was kicked off the rooftop.

Although it may seem like a stroke of luck to have run into him, his answer was not particularly discouraging to Al.

Because――,

Al: [――I've heard it plenty of times, so I don't have high expectations.]

With that, Al released his grip from the edge and let himself enter into a free fall.

Cecilus: [Oyo.]

Cecilus's voice sounded surprised and distant, and Al began to think amidst the floating sensation.

The distance to the ground was about 15 meters, a height that superhumans could have landed easily, but Al was an ordinary person and could die normally. The crushed tometo would be complete.

The approaching ground was wet cobblestone, there was not enough water to soften the impact of the fall, and the muddy soil offered no cushioning, making this an overly harsh method.

Therefore, in order to save himself, an action other than falling was needed here.

Al: [Oaaah!]

With a guttural sound from the back of his throat, Al extended his bent knees and kicked the wall as hard as he could.

Al's body, which should have fallen straight down, was propelled diagonally instead, shortening the distance to the opposite building, which was the same height as the one he’d been holding onto. The timing of the kick was between one and two seconds after the start of the fall, and if it was early or late he would hit the wall, and becoming a crushed tometo with a sore neck would be unavoidable.

But if the timing was right―― a moment later, Al's body smashed through the window of the building.

Al: [Guoh!]

Al rolled on his back into a deserted room, with a broken window as collateral damage. His shoulder and back were cut by the glass as he struck the floor and was severely injured.

Al: [But, I survived…]

After rolling backward into the room he’d flown into, Al jumped up and confirmed that he was alive. Next, he checked for fatal wounds and broken limbs, and only after passing this check was he allowed to declare himself a survivor.

Any injuries that are unrecoverable at this point must be recovered.

Al: [Wow, I ain't got a left hand! I mean, that's been like that for almost twenty years now...]

After a pause with some small senility, Al immediately hid beside the door facing the corridor and quickly drew the Blue Dragon Sword from behind his waist.

He had escaped falling to his death. However, his escape did cause him to jump into the building with a loud crash.

Naturally, the sound drew the attention of everyone in the surrounding area——,

???: [Around here!]

???: [Yeah!!]

An undead rushed into the room, breaking through the door in a run.

The undead yelled out in a powerful cry, but as their pale visage passed in front of him, Al swung his Blue Dragon Sword and decapitated them.

The first attacker was killed instantly, and the number of enemies that rushed in was confirmed using the headless body as a shield. There were two behind the broken door and the sound of one set of footsteps coming up the stairs, for a total of three—— beyond the corpse of the first one, the second, recovering from their startled face, thrust the short spear they held in their hands forward.

They recovered quickly. It sucked.

With that in mind, Al let the headless corpse interrupt the trajectory of his opponent's spear, and then——,

Al: [I messed up.]

After receiving a fatal blow, the first undead's body had quickly crumbled like a piece of pottery that lost its will.

Therefore, the familiar tactic of using a dead body as a shield would not work; Al realized this after he tasted the enemy's short spear fatally penetrating his chest.

×  ×  ×

???: [Around here!]

???: [Yeah!!]

The undead who kicked in the door was decapitated, accompanied by a flurry of rushing steps.

Kicking the headless corpse to the side, Al jumped out of the way to the back of the room. Following him, the second enemy rushed in, thrusting out a short spear in hand.

Al: [Dona!]

The tip of the short spear was swallowed by the earthen wall that rose up from the floor, forcibly capturing it.

As soon as Al saw that it had caught his opponent's attention, he put the sole of his foot on that earthen wall and,

Al: [Dona! Dona! Dona!]

A pillar of earth flew out sideways from the earthen wall against which he had placed his foot, striking the undead on the other side squarely in the face and blowing them backward.

The second undead attacker was pushed back by the pillar of earth. The third undead was about to follow behind him, but another pillar of earth was launched from the tip of the previous pillar, and the next pillar of earth from the tip of that pillar, launching like a multi-stage rocket and stamping the two undead together, crushing them both to death against the wall of the corridor.

Al: [One more to go…!]

Al heard the sound of large pieces of pottery shattering between the pillars and the wall and thought on how he had taken out as many as three of them in one breath, keeping his foot on the earthen wall and his eyes out for the enemy's movements.

He beat the first attacker with a surprise attack and the second and third attackers with tricks. Now, if only the fourth or fifth attacker could be made peace with, it would compensate for the bad situation and Al would be safe——,

Al: [Well, things aren't going to work out that way!]

The entire wall of earthen pillars blocking the entrance was smashed, and the last undead entered the room by forceful means.

It was an undead Cyclops with a huge battle axe in its hand and a massive golden eye in the center of its face. Upon seeing this, Al turned his back to them and headed for the window of the room——,

Al: [I'm not going to make it!]

Just when he was about to escape, he was struck by the destructive force of a battle-axe, mowing him down with his shouting back, leaving the interior of the building to be grotesquely redecorated with Al's scattered entrails.

×  ×  ×

???: [Around here!]

???: [Yeah!!]

Accompanied by a flurry of rushing steps, he decapitated the first undead attacker who had kicked down the door.

Next, he knew that there were two in the corridor and the worst of the enemies coming up the stairs. After that, Al leaped backward——,

Al: [Dona!]

He had to deal with the second and third attackers in front of him and open up an avenue of escape from the last monstrous attacker.

△▼△▼△▼△

Cecilus: [Woah, amazing amazing! The cyclops guy that came flying in at the end, I thought there would be no way Al would win but you did it.]

Al: [You’re such an asshole…]

Cecilus: [Well, well, I'm sure he was a formidable opponent, but I wouldn’t say that’s a likable attitude to have towards a foe with whom you have fought so hard. Of course, foul language and insults tend to make an impression, but I don't like the idea that notoriety is better than obscurity!]

Al: [I meant that to you…]

Al was greeted upon exiting the building, his whole body covered with a large number of wounds. As he breathed deeply he lethargically slumped his body against the wall and sat down.

Then Cecilus opened his eyes wide as he was greeted and rebuked by Al at the same time.

Al: [ What, I really can’t understand how you can be so surprised being talked to like that. You almost killed me twice. Even a psychopath bastard has at least a memory of being resented.]

Cecilus: [Oh, naturally I didn’t learn all of the Boss’s words in a short period of time, so there are some words I don't know. By the way, what is this “Psychopath”?]

Al: [It’s almost like being a deranged person.They go about killing people while composed.]

Cecilus: [Heh. But if that is the case, I don't think I am a psychopath.――I mean, Al-san somehow never dies.]

Cecilus laughed and then uttered a twisted self-defense.

At Cecilus’s answer, Al crouched in place and concentrated on regulating his breathing. While Al remained silent, Cecilus held up one finger and continued.

Cecilus: [The cyclops guy from earlier was very skilled. Unfortunately, he is far from reaching me, but if it were Al-san, you would lose a hundred times out of a hundred. This is the truth as I saw it with my own eyes!]

Al: [...But, I’m alive? Or are you saying I’m dead?]

Cecilus: [No no, I'm sure you're alive. I had a suspicion that perhaps an undead was posing as the living, but that does not seem to be the case. What I'm concerned about is this one thought. --Al-san drew the 101st chance.]

Cecilus held up one finger and another finger on the opposite hand to show two fingers.

One could do no more than add those two fingers up as two, if being generous it could be seen as eleven, but rather than being influenced by the intent of that gesture, Al held his breath at those words.

Cecilus: [I’m not concerned with the number 101. 102, 103 or even 200 would be fine!  Al would lose a hundred times out of a hundred to that cyclops tribe guy. But what if you did it a thousand times, ten thousand times or a hundred thousand times? You might literally pull off a million to one chance. You did that from the start. Am I wrong?]

Al: [――hk.]

In the midst of him being silent and focusing on his breathing, Al reached the limit of his deception.

Within Al’s steel helmet, the expression that Cecilus couldn’t see warped; he feared Cecilus from the bottom of his heart. Even Al did not understand what was the power of his observation, nor his speech and conduct.

The way Cecilus was speaking, he mostly guessed right at the Authority Al holds. It was not a logical statement, more of a guesswork.

The boy who called himself Cecilus Segmunt not only shared the same name as "(The) Blue Lightning," the strongest in the Vollachian Empire, but was clearly a foreigner to the world.

Al: [Maybe his height is because of the same reason as me and bro…]

Just like how Al and Subaru were affected by Olbart’s “Infantilization”, it is possible that Cecilus was also shrunken.

He didn’t see the person in question as the first among the Divine Generals, but he had a feeling that as his “Infantilization” became worse his consciousness became like his appearance. Cecilus was very likely to be the same.

In Al’s case, he was forced to optimize his mind, but that drastic measure could only be done by him and Subaru. Therefore, Cecilus was considered to have shrunken in mind.

If that was what made Cecilus a juvenile monster, the repercussions of Olbart's actions were grave.

Cecilus: [Do you have an answer, can you not answer or do you not want to answer…which one is it?]

At the quiet question from Cecilus, Al sat up, relying on the wall he was leaning against.

Within that silence, Cecilus harbored a tint of danger, and that was a sign that a pendulum was swinging within him. It was a pendulum that determined whether Al was an enemy or an ally.

It was an obsession with a trivial matter that was irrelevant even in this corpse city hit by an unprecedented disaster.

Cecilus: [I wonder I wonder. Let’s suppose that if Al has something that can pull a ten thousand to one chance on the first shot…I wonder if that could work on me too.]

In that case, it would be a million, or billion no trillion in one chance of that happening.

However, it was not zero.

Al: [I'm telling you…stop digging into my charm. Otherwise, you’ll have an unwanted partner watching you.]

Cecilus: [ Unbelievable! To be called a partner like that. I don’t dislike it, rather I quite like it.]

Al sighed at Cecilus whose reactions were getting more and more amused.

He wanted to find the words to dampen Cecilus’s amusement, but as one could see, he didn't have the time. He had finally pulled through the undead rush that came after the fall.

The burden was heavy, but he needed to advance the stage.

Al: [――Expand territory, begin thought experiment.]

Before Cecilus could make any unnecessary moves, Al redefined the matrix he had once set.

Though the backlash was too great due to its frequency and scale, Al had decided to ignore the consequences until he at least made his way out of the Vollachian Empire.—Reclaiming Priscilla was his top priority.

Al: [For that purpose, I would, over and over again—wha!?]

It was at the very moment he was about to utter his resolute declaration.

Quicker than he could finish, the figure of Cecilus in front of him blurred, and immediately afterward, Al was flipped sideways, taking Zorii's boot on his flank.

In response to such outrageous conduct, Al screamed while sliding on the ground.

Al: [What the heck! You talk about making a grand impression on stage, and then you attack while someone's in the middle of talking?!]

Cecilus: [No, no, no, that's not it at all! It's utterly out of the question for me to commit such rudeness! That would be an offense warranting kappuku. No, rather, look—]

Al: [Look at what...?]

As Al finished sliding and rose to his feet, the defending Cecilus gestured towards the wall. There, at the chest height of where Al had been standing just moments before, was a fist-sized hole.

It hadn't been there a moment ago. However, the hole had appeared suddenly.

That meant—

Al: [Sniper... gyah!]

Cecilus: [A slight indiscretion!]

In the instant his eyes widened, Cecilus's form blurred once more, and Al felt the acceleration force throughout his body as he was thrust straight backwards.

Cecilus, running furiously, had hooked his hand around Al's waist and dragged him along in a swift sprint. And as if clinging to them, becoming one with the wind—

Al: [Hey, hey, hey, what in the world, what's happening?!]

Amidst the illusion of being flung backward, Al's vision was filled with city streets and building walls being pierced one after the other, as something ferocious danced in pursuit

If the initial impression was correct, it was sniper fire. Sniper fire chasing after Al and Cecilus.

Al: [Snipers are supposed to stay put, that's the golden rule!]

They lie in wait, take aim once the target is in their sights, and strike with a lethal shot.

That's the basics of sniping, the golden rule. Yet, this sniper was defying it all, accurately following the fleeing pair, anticipating their moves to cover, aiming ahead as if foreseeing their every move.

It was as if they were surrounded by a hundred snipers, or by a single sniper with the ability to move at high speed at will.

Cecilus: [Whoa! Easy there! Whoopsie!]

Al: [Bwah! Oof! Bit my tongue!]

While being targeted by this terrifyingly precise and agile sniper, Cecilus, carrying Al, moved right and left, up and down, continuously dodging the assault.

However, he didn't seem to be looking around at all. Al realized—it was intuition. Cecilus was dodging these top-class shots with sheer intuition.

Cecilus: [It’s not quite like that. Don't you feel a certain thrill at moments the opponent deems critical? That's it.]

Al: [Forget about my questions! Focus more on what you're doing!]

Cecilus: [Very well. But our opponent is quite skilled.—I've encountered them a few times before but have never managed to close in.]

The ground erupted with explosive sounds that seemed impossible from just being kicked by Zorii's boots, gaining propulsive force, Cecilus accelerated. Al, experiencing the proximity of sniper fire and clinging to Cecilus, was struck by a dual shock

One was the revelation that Cecilus had already encountered this enemy several times before and continued to survive.

The second shock for Al was the realization that this enemy remained undefeated even by Cecilus, an abnormally formidable adversary.

Cecilus: [I believe they're flying, but it's not just their speed that makes them invisible.]

Al: [An invisible enemy...]

Al latched onto the phrase from Cecilus, who seemed to lack a proper sense of danger.

If they could unravel the mechanism behind this invisibility, or at least find some measure of counteraction.

Cecilus: [Oops, this is—]

Once more, Cecilus spoke with a lack of urgency, and a tremendous crashing sound followed, prompting Al to look back—toward the direction they were heading.

Then, within Al's field of vision, three buildings along their path came crashing down.

From the front of the street and from both sides, buildings converged upon them. Each had its foundation targeted and hollowed out by the sniper, tilting and collapsing inwards.

If they were crushed, there would be no escaping from being crushed to death. Upon realizing this, Al clenched his molars.

Al: [Territory, redefinition――!]

Cecilus: [I'm heading straight ahead!]

Immediately after the redefinition of the territory, Cecilus, kicking the ground while holding Al, broke through the window of the front collapsing building and plunged inside.

Amidst the gentle chain of shattering windows glass as the wall flexed and slanted, Cecilus kicked the floor of the collapsing building, shattered the ceiling, and sprinted upwards, forcibly creating a direct route from the lower floor to the upper floor.

Cecilus: [Go go go go go go go go!]

Given the building's collapse, it was the fact that the crushing collapse that makes contact with the street began on the lower floors.

On the other hand, escaping from being crushed in such a manner was an outrageous feat and far from a sane course of action. One should not speak of it.

Yet, thanks to that extraordinary judgment, Al and Cecilus managed to break through the ceiling of the top floor and escape to the outside, even faster than the building could fall down――,

Al: [――No, this won’t work.]

Bursting through the ceiling, Al and Cecilus soared into the sky.

Below them, they could witness three collapsing buildings colliding with one another, their colossal mass causing a tremendous earthquake as they headed towards collapse. Flames could be seen spreading across the streets, perhaps ignited by flammable liquor or stored magic crystal within one of the fallen structures.

However――,

Cecilus: [This this is a formidable enemy!]

Both Cecilus's cheerful exclamation and the shuddering impact that ran through Al's body happened simultaneously.

However, Al wasn't the one directly affected by the impact. It was Cecilus, who had leaped into the sky alongside Al――struck by a sniper shot, an impact that blew away one of his legs.

The young boy’s small left leg was blown off below the knee, scattering blood into the air as he gritted his teeth. Al, having experienced similar situations, understood. That the pain would come immediately, causing the throat to scream――,

Cecilus: [――Over there!]

Instead of screaming, Cecilus yelled, likely pinpointing the enemy across the sky.

He then placed the remaining leg against Al's body which he was holding, using it as leverage to propel himself towards something he'd spotted.

With propulsion from just one leg, his momentum was fierce, seemingly sufficient to catch up to the enemy.

All this while in a state of having lost one leg――.

Al: [――That won’t do]

Even with one leg lost, Cecilus might still probably be a hundred times stronger than Al.

However, it wouldn’t work. He needed to be in perfect condition. Thus, Al drew his Blue Dragon Sword and pressed it against his own neck.

And without hesitation, he forcefully swung the blade――.

×  ×  ×

Cecilus: [Heading stra――]

Al: [No, the building on the right!!]

As buildings collapsed from three directions, the moment Cecilus prepared to plunge inside the front one, Al's voice, matching the volume of the collapsing structures’ sound, shouted to change their path.

The instant he heard Al's complaint, Cecilus laughed and licked his lips.

In that moment, Cecilus forcefully altered their direction, grabbed Al and lunged towards the collapsing building on the right.

Amidst the chain of shattering windows glass, Al pointed towards the depths of the room they jumped into,

Al: [The room over there! Secure the box inside!]

Cecilus: [Aye-aye sir!]

At Al's confident instructions, Cecilus followed without questioning.

Forcefully shattering through the wall into the adjacent room, he found an iron box――a part of the property kept by the owner of the building, intended for emergency situations.

Unfortunately, the owner seemed unprepared and unable to bring it out. Thanks to that, Al and Cecilus were able to secure it.

Al: [Above!]

Immediately after securing the box, the escape from the tilting building reverted the line to one that employed Cecilus's extraordinary leg strength and innovative thinking.

Carrying Al with the box, Cecilus's sprint pierced through the ceilings of the lower floors and the floors of the upper ones successively, dashing all the way up to the top floor at once.

And the moment he kicked the ceiling of the top floor and leaped out, Al, faced with a scenery he had lost count of how many times he had seen, dropped the box from his hands.

Just before the sniper shot could blow off any of Cecilus's limbs from afar――,

Al: [――Dona.]

Inside the box that was dropped, Al's shoddy magic sparked a fire that ignited a high-purity magic stone that was the property of someone in the empire, and then at once, the blast swelled up and flame engulfed them from directly below.

Al: [――――]

The scorching heat roasted his skin, but the curtain of flames that was created hid Al and Cecilus from their surroundings. However, even if the flames hid them only for this moment, this sniper would shoot through Al or――no, he would shoot through Cecilus without losing sight of him.

So, the aim was not to disturb the sniper's eye.

Cecilus: [――Over there.]

Cecilus muttered this while smiling with bared teeth.

Cecilus' cheek was spurted with blood, and his long blue hair that had its hair clip snatched and burst apart by the sniper, spread out. However, all of Cecilus' limbs were intact.

The curtain of flame was not to hide Cecilus from the enemy, but to make him see the bullets approaching him before they reached him.

Before reaching Cecilus, the bullet broke through the curtain of flame.

It was foolish, but he bet that Cecilus would not miss the change of flame the moment before the bullet reached him. He won that bet.

――Hence, across the curtain of flame, Cecilus' and the sniper's gazes intersected.

Cecilus: [――――]

In an instant, the pupils of Cecilus' eyes narrowed and the sole of his zori sandals was placed against Al's hip.

As before, Cecilus intended to leap down to the shooter's location. The difference is that all of Cecilus' limbs were attached to his small torso.

If this goes well, then afterwards――,

Al: [――Don’t mess this up.]

Muttering that,Al prepared for the next domain expansion.

Each time it happened, he felt a sense of loss in his head, as if something was shredded, but Cecilus was right. A once in a lifetime opportunity was an opportunity that came only once in a million.

If you want it twice, then it can't come after a compromise.

That's why, Al was going to reset the matrix for the next――,

Al: [――There’s a gap between the clouds.]

Just before that, a strange change struck Al's vision.

It was behind the curtain of flame, that is, in the direction where Cecilus judged the snipers to be, in the sky where Al still had no enemy in sight, there was an unusual change in his vision.

Quite simply, the clouds had been severed.

The thick black clouds that covered the sky of the dead city of Lupugana were unexpectedly cut open. The cumulus clouds received not one, but two to three cuts in succession.

It was as if they were chasing an invisible enemy in the sky――no, not as if.

The slashes were chasing the enemy and the aftermath was tearing through the black clouds.

Cecilus: [AA――hk! They’re getting away, they’re getting away! They’re escaping!!]

The screeching voice belonged to Cecilus, who kept his foot on Al's back.

His eyes widened, and the reason for his scream was in response to the sniper running away from the slash that tore through the clouds――abandoning the battle and disengaging.

From Al's point of view, it was a profitable event, but not for Cecilus. He stared at the view below with eyes brimming with frustration.

Then there he――,

Cecilus: [Ha ha ha ha! Run, run in fear of my accomplished swordsmanship!]

Al and Cecilus jumped out, away from the three collapsing buildings, and then a lone figure could be seen on the roof of the building.

It was a figure with a sword in his hand, looking off at the enemy who was moving away from him, and smiling broadly as he pointed his sword that had cut through the clouds toward the heavens.

Al frowned, wondering who or what the stranger was.

Behind Al, Cecilus said "Huh," as he looked at the sudden intruder,

Cecilus: [You've aged a lot in the time since I've seen you, Dad.]

Al: [Pops?]

Al was stunned by Cecilus’s innocent voice.

The person Cecilus called his father, visible in the distance, would join them, which was a good thing, but the problem was――

Al: [...You're not going to die after this, are you?]

After the formidable sniper was gone, Al, while looking directly down at the three buildings that were still in a state of violent collapse, muttered to Cecilus about what was ahead, feeling the sensation of floating.
