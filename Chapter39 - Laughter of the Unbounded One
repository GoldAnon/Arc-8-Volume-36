*This is a Work in Progress, everything is subject to change*

――Cecilus Segmunt was a Stargazer.

That was something different to the official position of the Vollachian Empire, to which Ubilk, who was one among them, had been appointed to by Vincent Vollachia for the first time; he was a Stagazer in the original sense―― Bestowed with a commandment, they were beings that would relinquish anything and everything in order to fulfill their grand purpose.

The compulsive force that acted on a person who was bestowed with a commandment, becoming a Stargazer, was quite strong.

That possessed such a power to interfere with human life that it could give a mere male prostitute the influential voice to frequent the palace in order to give his opinion to the Emperor, cause a frail mother to forget the love she felt for her daughter who she had given birth to on the verge of death, and easily make someone abandon the objective they had devoted their entire life to, even contemplating suicide for. 

Many Stargazers would distort the lives they had been living until then upon receiving their commandment, and would be forced to convert the policy of how they lived with no other choice. And, they did not consider that as a tragedy.

No matter how abnormal or pitiful it might seem to those around them, that was so.

Among those Stargazers, Rowan Segmunt was the sole exception.

After all, the commandment bestowed upon him overlapped with the great ambition he had aimed for from the very beginning, and aside from the person in question, it did not seem to the people around him that his way of life had been distorted.

How his dearest wish and bestowed commandment compromised, and how his current faith was established has already been disclosed, so it will be omitted here.

What shall be discussed here is the being who was born into this world as the end result of the commandment bestowed upon Rowan Segmunt; Cecilus Segmunt, the fact that he was also a Stargazer, and――,

――The reality that among the Stargazers, Cecilus Segmunt was the sole unbounded one.

△▼△▼△▼△

Cecilus, with the hem of his hakama fluttering in the blowing wind, rested his hand on his forehead to shield his eyes as he gazed out into the distance.

Al's proposed strategy to take down the star-shaped walls surrounding the Imperial Capital and its five bastions.

This will open holes in the undead's solid defenses to bring in reinforcements from the outside. Cecilus would welcome more actors who look good onstage and an audience that can see their work in action.

If this was foreshadowing for later exciting developments, working earnestly at a modest job is not a bad idea.

Cecilus: [However! Don't forget that it's only because you're promised a reward afterward!]

In theater, in war, and in everything else, there is the right person in the right place.

Cecilus' philosophy is that no matter where you are in the world, you are always on the stage, ――it would take a long time to explain it. Still, there are some things that people are not suited for, with Cecilus not being good at detailed work or steady accumulation of work. if anything, it was a miscasting.

From the standpoint of stage direction, it would be a real misstep to have lead actors in the center of the stage, who attract the audience's attention, work under the cover of a stagehand's black clothes.

Cecilus: [Wouldn't the audience agree with that point?]

Tilting his head to look up at the sky, Cecilus speaks to an unseen party.

Of course, normally, if one were to imitate such a thing, a cloudy sky with black clouds would never give an answer back to those on the ground. ――Yes, normally.

However, Cecilus was not ordinary; he was the leading actor of this world.

――Voices from the audience, unheard by the others, were heard only by Cecilus.

It was a loud voice that spoke to Cecilus in a whisper. The voice was as dignified as it was imprudent and spoke to Cecilus divinely as if it did not know what etiquette was.

Moreover――,

???: [■■■■]
???: [■●■●■●■]
???: [――■■]
???: [●●●●●!!]
???: [■■■■●●■■]
???: [●●■■●■■●●]
???: [■■!!]
???: [●●●■■■]
???: [■■■●■●●■■●●]
???: [●●■●■●●●■■●――]
???: [●●…■]
???: [●■●■●■●■]

With excessive force and volume, it poured down upon Cecilus.

Enthusiastic about what the lead actor, Cecilus, had to say, the audience answered him ――no, that was not it. This is not the answer Cecilus had in mind when speaking to the audience.

These were the voices that poured upon Cecilus' every move, everything he did.

It is something that Cecilus has heard endlessly since he can remember, something that tried to compel him to do this or that――,

Cecilus: [Ha ha ha, it seems like you're enjoying yourselves very much today, too! I know, I know. I can't help but captivate people with my every gesture! You will not be able to take your eyes off of my activities for even a second in the future, so please keep watching!]

For Cecilus, who never listens to a word that his fans say to him, received enthusiastic cheers from them.

――As previously stated, Cecilus Segmunt is a Stargazer.

Among most of the Stargazers, ――even Rowan Segmunt, who stood as an exception, had their way of life distorted for the fulfillment of the commandment they were given.

A commandment has that much coercive power; the life of the Stargazer is governed by it.

Except for Cecilus Segmunt, the only Stargazer outside the pale.

Cecilus: [Thank you, thank you, for your encouragement. As usual, I don't understand what you're saying at all, and I don't listen to you, but don't worry! I will not disappoint you! I live up to expectations! That's how I live my life as the leading actor!]

???: [――Oh, you fucking idiot. Stop making a racket; it'll be a damn pain in the ass if they find us.]

Cecilus: [Oops!]

Cecilus, who had been listening to the audience's enthusiasm as usual, turned around at the call of ――Groovy, the hyena-man who was approaching him from behind.

With his hands on his hip, Cecilus was fascinated by Groovy's wary gaze.

This beastman warrior, Groovy, who is no taller than himself, is very good.

First of all, he has an attractive and beautiful appearance. He is also among the top five most skilled fighters Cecilus has seen since he arrived from the island. There is an expectation that he will have an interesting fighting style that cannot be simply measured by his swordsmanship.

Cecilus: [Regrettably, there is a bit of a problem with the language. If you use too many foul words, your dignity will deteriorate! You cannot maintain your dignity once you are degraded, even if you are skilled. Anyone who goes down this path of killing and being killed with me should expect the same level of dignity from the other person!]

Groovy: [Don't be a fucking idiot and start talking nonsense! First of all, who is gonna be killing with you anyway? Chisha's was a fucking asshole doing something unnecessary...]

Cecilus: [Well, well, that's a name I've heard a passing reference to. Your vague reply is worrisome, but what is your connection to the person whose name is being discussed here?]

Groovy: [It has something to do with you shrinking and forgetting. ――Chisha is the one who shrunk you, the one with the head that was too fucking big for him.]

Hearing Groovy's response, Cecilus responded, "Mmmm," making a noise with his throat.

However, the often-repeated claim that he was shrunk still did not feel right from Cecilus' point of view. Whether Cecilus has shrunk or not, as far as he is concerned, he is all that he is here.

Of course, the fact that Rowan had aged a bit in the time since his last encounter and that he was already known as The Blue Lightning, a name that was sure to shake the world in the years to come, was not without its persuasive power.

Cecilus: [It's a little hard to fathom that this Chisha person made me small, isn't it?]

Groovy: [Oh? You're going to give me shit about how it's impossible for people to shrink, aren't you?]

Cecilus: [No, no, that isn’t it. There are no limits to what people can imagine, and what they envision can come true. This kind of openness is one of the reasons why I like this world so much, so it is no wonder that people are shrinking. What I find hard to believe is quite simple. ――Who could ever exploit such an opening in me?]

Groovy: [――――]

In response to Cecilus' question, with his hands clasped behind his head, Groovy made a solemn face.

Even his wrinkled expression had a charm to it, making one think that every stage needs a lively character like Groovy. Yet, even for him, Cecilus' question seemed to have an impact.

Cecilus himself does not think he is invincible or immortal. 

If his heart were gouged out, his slender neck severed, or nearly half of his blood drained, he would die, like any other person.

But who, for that matter, would be capable of such a deed?

In this regard, Groovy realized the contradiction in his own thoughts. No matter who the adversary is, no one can diminish Cecilus――.

Groovy: [――Did that bastard Chisha twist his brain, or did you let your guard down, you damn idiot?]

Cecilus: [Huh!? Are you saying that while looking at me!?]

Groovy: [I do. It's damn obvious]

Cecilus: [Is that so obvious? Ahaha, that’s a low blow, but you got me!]

Laughing and clapping his hands in response to Groovy's words, Cecilus shook his head, as if to say, "Wait a minute."

It was an evaluation that made you want to cover your face in embarrassment. Well, Cecilus understood his own abilities, and even someone as strong as Groovy couldn't completely dispel such doubts.

Cecilus: [In the end, someone as big as me isn't anything special, huh! I will never become someone who receives such evaluations, given my current sorry state! Please wait and see in ten years!]

Groovy: [Who's gonna stick around for your growth for a whole ten years! Quit talking shit and get back to your original size already!]

Cecilus: [But even if you tell me to return to my original size right away, I don’t particularly want to... And do you, Groovy-san, know how to revert back?]

Groovy: [I don't know, but that bastard Chisha who set this up probably does. These ninja tricks have some damn time or condition-based restrictions. Chisha would likely have some conditions.]

Cecilus: [Oh, oh, I see. So, this Chisha person is a ninja, huh? Are they an acquaintance, friend, or blood relative of that energetic old man?]

Groovy: [I don’t know, and Chisha isn't a ninja. It's just his method that’s ninja-like... Ah, this is so annoying]

Groovy scratched his head vigorously, complaining like a know-it-all.

Cecilus had a hunch that Groovy seemed knowledgeable about various things, but what was more important than the true identity of this Chisha person was probably clearing the conditions he had set.

If he were to ask that, Groovy would probably get angry and say, "There's no way I would know!"

Cecilus: [So, what do you think the conditions are for me to revert?]

Groovy: [I have no damn clue!]

Cecilus: [See?]

Cecilus chuckled, just as he had anticipated, while Groovy grumbled unhappily with an "Ah?"

Just then, as the two were conversing――,

???: [Sorry to interrupt your fun conversation, friends, but can we put an end to this amusement time for now?]

Cecilus: [Oh, it's Al-san.]

The owner of the weary, exasperated voice was Al, who had arrived on the rooftop where Cecilus and Groovy were standing.

He appeared from the stairs on the top floor and tapped his foot on the steps.

Al: [I’m serious, please. It's tough when you casually hop up to the rooftop, leaving me to use the stairs. Groovy, you too.]

Groovy: [Damn, sorry. I got carried away with this idiot’s chatter.]

Groovy, with a frown, sincerely apologized to Al, who had been left waiting downstairs. 

Cecilus had gone up to the building for a quick lookout, as Groovy had expressed concern about something across the street, but he had gotten a bit too distracted.

In any case――,

Cecilus: [Well, well, Al-san, don't be so angry. Groovy-san seems to be reflecting with his ears drooping like this, so you must be feeling forgiving by now, right?]

Al: [I’m not surprised by your relentless 'do-it-my-way' attitude anymore. But more importantly, did you notice anything while you were observing?]

Cecilus: [Yeah. Well... the defenses at the first, second, and third positions seem the strongest. It seems like a natural strategy considering the direction the bosses likely retreated.]

Al: [Those three spots...]

With his one-armed right hand, Al touches the fittings of the helmet, and Cecilus ponders Al's response.

The numbers Cecilus mentioned were names for the vertices of the star-shaped city walls surrounding the Imperial Capital.

The northernmost point with a sparkling castle was the first, the northwest was the second, and the northeast was the third. Following that, the southwest was the fourth, and the southeast was the fifth. Among them, the defenses at the three locations along the northern river were the strongest.

Conversely, the two southern locations could be considered a target but――,

Groovy: Such an easily obvious hole seems suspicious.]

Cecilus: [Can Groovy-san's nose detect the smell of such shenanigans?]

Groovy: [It can't be that fucking suspicious! This is just my judgment as a General! Don't make excuses for your shrinkage, too... aw never mind, that doesn't make sense.]

Al?: [What the hell? You know, it bothers me when you stop what you’re saying in the middle of it.]

Groovy: [From the start, this asshole didn't have a job as a "General" even if he hadn't shrunk.]

Groovy's bitter face was followed by a comprehending "Ahー" from Cecilus and Al.

From Cecilus' perspective, he didn't get the impression that he was being made fun of. It was simply a fact. If Cecilus really did shrink as a result of his carelessness, he didn't think he would have guided or gotten close to anyone before he shrunk.

So he had no particular objection to Groovy's argument.

Cecilus: [But I agree with you that it is blatant. But then again, if that’s true then that is. Unexpectedly, Al-san is also a tactician.]

Al: [...What do you mean?]

Cecilus: [Because number four and five look like they are easy to fall, and looks like they are luring you into a trap...that's where you sent my dad and his friend there, so you're a tactician.]

Al: [――――]

As they talked about the two people who were not here and who were working separately, Rowan and Heinkel,Cecilus chuckled at Al's suggestion to split up the group.

In front of the smiling Cecilus, Al silently choked up and fell silent.

Currently, Cecilus and the team of five members were divided into teams of three and two respectively, and each were on a mission to capture the five bastions.

And it was Al who instructed Rowan and Heinkel to attack the southwest and southeast, the fourth and fifth bastions, and his intentions were clear.

Cecilus: [If there is a relationship and war asset that is not painful to lose, it will be used as a sacrificial pawn to attract the enemy's attention. Al-san might be modest, but he is still a tactician!]

Al: [...Do you have a problem with the way I used your Dad?}

Cecilus: [No? As a performer, I’m thankful to have gathered five people for the climax rather than have them scattered, and isn’t that a very decent way of thinking as a soldier? It's not for me to say, but there's no point in expecting my Dad to be cooperative.]

Groovy: [That’s true, that is something to discuss.]

As for cooperation, one could only assume that Segmunt and his son were born with a fault.

In any case, Al racked his brain over how to make the best use of his limited resources. If one's head for thinking or tactical intuition were working, one might be able to imagine what the required role would be.

Groovy: [We can't take our fucking time to capture them one by one. If that red middle-aged man and blue middle-aged man can't realize that, we'll just have them do their fucking job as sacrificial pieces.]

Al: [Yeah. We can't just make a big mess in one place and have all of our resources there.]

Cecilus: [Hence the distributed attack...but it was a bit surprising. You see, Al-san was talking to Heinkel-san like they were buddies.]

AL: [I'm no hero. I can prioritize properly.]

Somewhat self-mocking, it seemed to Cecilus that it was not about Heinkel's usage, but about his own.

He didn't know that the response would change Al's impression of him in any way――,

Cecilus: [――I see. You are different from Boss.]

Al: [――――]

For some reason, Al turned to face Cecilus, who had said what he was thinking.

Al's expression was hidden by his iron helmet, but the sharpness and heat of his gaze sometimes spoke more eloquently about what he felt on the inside than words or expression.

Cecilus: [Well, just because it is true at times doesn't mean it is true now.]

Al: [...I don't know what you're talking about, but okay. I'm not like bro.]

Cecilus: [Hmm? It's natural for things to be different, isn’t it fine like that?I think Al-san is tougher than the boss.]

Cecilus tilted his head, as if he was inferior for some reason.

Strong and weak, beautiful and dirty, like and dislike, they are all like the phases of the same moon. They may be worth a moment of joy or sorrow, but they do not have the weight to tip the scales of life.

Even right and wrong are not absolutes.

Cecilus: [The boss is the one who struggles against death and muddles his way through but still chooses the cleanest and most stage-worthy method. Al-san, on the other hand, is different. He works hard and has deathly struggles in a crude way, making everyone want to turn their heads away. It is not about superiority or inferiority. That is the difference between you and the boss.]

Al: [――――]

Cecilus: [Oh, putting aside the talk of superiority and inferiority, it is different if you want to talk about how you want to be. How you want to be in the eyes of others is up to each individual to figure out… defecation is dirty, but I want to make even defecation beautiful and attractive!]

Al: [Now I got to do a little rethinking…!]

Cecilus: [Sorry, What Groovy-san said just stuck in my ear.]

However, even though the way the topic jumps around may be due to Groovy's influence, the statement itself does not lie.

Cecilus's theory is that a leading actor must add a reason for people to keep their eyes on them, even when they do something dirty and unseemly that they would rather turn away from.

Groovy: [So? Are you done fucking wasting time with your ramblings? Life advice is bullshit. After this is all over, I'm just going to hold a fucking vigil at your grave.]

Cecilus: [...If you say it like that, it will stick in your ear.]

Al: [Is that right?]

Cecilus laughed as Al's shoulders slumped at Groovy's incessant swearing.

Although Cecilus has made a lot of ill-suited arguments, he had no objection to Al's plan and did not mind if Rowan and Heinkel encountered difficulties as planned.

The only thing is that Cecilus might have his own problems with Al's plan.

Cecilus: [I wonder if my rather selfish father will do what Al-san says?]

Unusually, Cecilus did not run his mouth about what he thought because, again, unusually, Cecilus was completely dismissive of his father, Rowan's, nature.

Rowan doesn't do what he doesn't want to do and will absolutely do what he wants to do.

It was a trait that Cecilus had inherited as well, but Rowan and Cecilus were not the same. This was the same as what he had just told Al about with his boss, Schwartz.

It was not a question of good or bad. It was about how to live and how to die.

Groovy: [So, where do you intend to attack from, you helmet fuck?]

Al: [――. The Crystal Palace is out of the question. So besides the first, number two or three… I want to avoid the area where the sniper from earlier is. Number three.]

Cecilus: [Eeh! I want my revenge!]

Groovy: [Don't say bullshit when you can't spare the time! You have no idea who you're dealing with――]

Cecilus: [Ugh, I get it.]

Groovy snapped at him, and Cecilus retracted his comment with a pout of his lips. Groovy, who had raised his fist in the air, widened his eyes at Cecilus' reaction.

Seeing this, Cecilus responded, "What is that for?" as Groovy lowered his raised arm,

Groovy: [You're listening to obediently. You were more fucking dense before getting shrunk than after.]

Cecilus: [Hoho, That doesn't sound like a compliment, now does it?]

Groovy: [Shut the fuck up! We're running out of time. Let's get fucking moving.]

Cocking his chin, Groovy turned his head toward the third bastion. Cecilus was about to follow with a "yes, yes," when Al, the originator of the idea, said, "Is it okay? "

Al: [You asked, so I answered. No, you are more familiar with Imperial Capital than I am.]

Groovy: [Even I wouldn't accept a shitty plan. I don't have a problem with your plan... I don't want to screw with that balleroy fuck either.]

Al: [...he was originally one of your colleagues?]

Groovy: [That's part of it, and also because he's fucking strong. If you want me to fight with a bastard, it's going to be Moguro. I'm absolutely not going to lose.]

Groovy asserted that the sniper's ability was strong.

Cecilus has also encountered this opponent many times in the Imperial Capital but has yet to even see him properly. There is no doubt that he is strong. After all, was it a mistake for Al to nod his head just now? He wondered if they would agree to change the plan if he complained to them now. Would they?

Cecilus: [Let's go in and get it done in a jiffy. The goal is not to hold the hole we've opened, so there's no point in putting it off.]

Groovy: [Be careful. This fucking idiot is going to wrap things up and look for Balleroy quickly.]

Al: [...Once the real top performer shows up, please do so.]

Cecilus: [How arrogant of you to call anyone other than me a top performer!]

Al shook his head and grumbled in resignation while Cecilus exclaimed in chagrin.

△▼△▼△▼△

The journey to the third bastion was an anticlimactic and smooth one.

It is not that they did not see any undead searching for survivors along the way. But if they were blocking their route, they eliminated them; if not, they were just extras passing by.

Would any actor go out of their way to give a bit-part to liven up the stage?

Cecilus: [Unfortunately, an audience's interest is finite. I'm not saying that there aren't supporting actors who give great performances that elevate the overall quality of the stage, but whether they're needed or not is something else... Nevertheless.]

While enjoying the peaceful path, Cecilus, however, furrowed his brow.

Of course, Cecilus was all for eliminating unnecessary hassles, and he did not think it desirable that a performance would involve time and effort spent dealing with miscellaneous soldiers.

However, the way Cecilus and his group look now was unfashionable, was it not?

After all, Cecilus was on Al's back, and Groovy was clinging to his side ――in other words, Cecilus and Groovy were making an Al sandwich.

They were in such a situation because otherwise, Cecilus and the others would protrude from the coverage of the cloak that Al was wearing over his head.

Cecilus: [But this is not stylish! This is not how I market myself, Groovy-san!]

Groovy: [Shut up! Our presence may be hidden, but our sounds and smells aren't! If the other assholes around here find out and surround us, we'll be in a lot of fucking trouble!]

???: [You two are loud...! And don't wiggle, or you'll fall...!]

Complaining and shaking Al's shoulder, the two of them wrapped in the same cloak were reprimanded.

The leather cloak that Groovy had prepared was quite an impressive piece of work, and it could apparently be used to prevent the wearer from attracting the attention of others. Rowan, Heinkel, and Groovy used this robe to enter the Imperial Capital under the radar of the enemy.

In fact, even though they have chosen to remain inconspicuous, the leather cloak probably played a significant role in the fact that the undead had never spotted them.

Cecilus: [I can't imagine how you and my father managed to get into Imperial Capital in this sweltering heat, given your size difference. But still, where did you buy such a bizarre cloak?]

Groovy: [I didn't buy it. I made it. You're too fucking stupid to remember, but I reforged your Fiend Sword.]

Cecilus: [Hohoho, Fiend Sword. That's a cool name! I'd love to see it, learn about it, and worship it!]

Groovy: [That's why it's your fucking sword!]

Groovy performed the feat of yelling in a quiet voice.

Putting aside the debate about shrinking or not shrinking, it was quite interesting to hear him tell the story about Cecilus, which he did not know himself. In particular, he particularly enjoyed talking about swords.

Cecilus: [But it's interesting that you re-forged a sword. Are you also a blacksmith Groovy-san? You're very busy being a general and a blacksmith.]

Groovy: [I don't specialize in swords. I make swords and also weave robes and tinker with magical tools.]

Cecilus: [So, this mysterious cloak is also a kind of magical tool.]

Groovy: [No, this one is just werewolf skin.]

Cecilus was impressed by Groovy's response, and Al's shoulders shook in shock while Cecilus inspected the skin.

Cecilus: [It's rare to see a werewolf. I know they exist, but I've never seen one before.]

Groovy: [They're hard to find in the first place because the whole race is under a Divine Protection, much like ground dragons and the Urchas of the Holy Kingdom. If you skin them alive, the Divine Protection remains on their skin. It's a good use of these tricksy bastards.]

Al: [The Divine Protection of the Vanishing Cloud…]

Groovy: [Oh? That's a fucking old-fashioned name for it, you know. the Divine Protection of Ambush is more common… although stories about fucking werewolves ain't common in the first place.]

Hearing Al's mumbled comment, Groovy shared his knowledge.

Regardless, werewolves are hated in the empire, and it stems from an old, old story. However, since the story is based on historical facts, it is also deeply linked to reality.

Cecilus himself has no particular hostility toward werewolves or wolf people――,

Cecilus: [How ironic that the skin of a werewolf is helping us, considering the way werewolves are treated in the Empire. If only for the skin.]

Groovy and Al: [――――]

Cecilus: [Huh? Are you ignoring me? You're ignoring me? I thought I said something rather good――]

Just after Cecilus thought that Al and Groovy both gave a blunt response to Cecilus' mention of the fur cloak ――Cecilus sensed that this was not the case.

???: [――■■■■■■]

Not because the onlooker was as lively as usual.

Al's whole body tensed as Cecilus clung to him, and Cecilus felt the reason for that tension slipping into his own body as well.

Putting aside the discussion of shrinking, it was something that captured what was in the thin Cecilus's chest.

――Gray thorns swirled around Cecilus' chest in a spiral.

Cecilus: [Is this by any chance appearing on both of you?]

Al: [...Hey, Groovy-san. With this cloak, we shouldn't be able to get detected…]

Groovy: [Fuck...! What a fucking joke...!]

Al and Groovy, who apparently were in the same situation as Cecilus, were quite distraught and angry, especially Groovy.

Maybe because someone saw through the effectiveness of the leather cloak that he was so confident in? ――No, that was not quite right.

If the other party has located Cecilus and the others, they will not leave the three of them in a sandwich state for long. Of course, some could say that thorns were a warning.

Cecilus: [It doesn't seem to be. The heart of it is?]

Groovy: [――It's an indiscriminate ranged attack. What kind of fucking idiot does that! Who's the fuck is blasting this stupid spell...!]

Groovy's throat shook with rage, and cursed the insanity of the as-yet-unseen master of the thorns.

A moment later, the thorns around the three's chest slowly wriggled, and the sharp thorns that slipped through their hands tried to exert the full effect of their curse.

And then――,

Cecilus: [――I see that the world doesn't approve of me sneaking around after all. Now, let's get over this new hardship with a flourish!]

This was the laughter of the unbounded one that spilled out just before a sharp pain seized his heart.
